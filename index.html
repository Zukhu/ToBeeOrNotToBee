                    Bees are our predominant pollinators, pollinating a third of the food we eat and 80% of flowering plants. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Pollination is crucial because many of our vegetables, fruits and the crops that feed our livestock rely on it to be fertilised, so without it, we could go hungry. Vegetables such as broccoli, asparagus and cucumber rely on the pollination of bees, as do apricots, strawberries, apples, tomatoes and almonds. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While there are other methods of pollination, including by the wind, birds, bats and other insects, wild bees are among the most important pollinators because they are capable of pollinating on a much bigger scale.

                    Habitat loss
                    <br>
                    An increase in urban developments and invasive farming methods has meant that many of the areas bees once called home no longer exist. These developments are as much a threat to bees as they are to trees and woodland. In the wild, several species of bee nest in hollow trees, so as more trees are destroyed so are the homes these bees live in. Wildflower meadows and other areas abundant in flowering plants are also in serious decline, meaning that bees lose an important food resource.

                    Pesticides
                    <br>
                    One of the main threats to our beloved bees is the use of toxic pesticides. Whilst pesticides are designed to kill pests, due to their intense toxicity they are having an adverse effect on other insects too, including bees. Neonicotinoids in particular cause bees a great deal of harm, as when they are sprayed onto plants they are absorbed. So, when a bee comes to pollinate said plant, it will ingest this pesticide. This can seriously damage the bee’s central nervous system.

                    Climate change
                    <br>
                    It disrupts bee nesting behaviour and alters the normal seasonal timings, meaning flowers may bloom earlier or later than expected. Whilst the planting of more trees is helping to mitigate some of the effects of climate change, it is still a serious issue that could prove deadly for many of our bees.

                    Parasites and diseases
                    <br>
                    Parasites and diseases are another big threat to bees. The varroa mite, Varroa destructor, is a parasitic mite which clings to the back of the honey bee, passing diseases and viruses to it and gradually draining its strength.

                    Invasive species
                    <br>
                    Non-native species can pose another threat to bees. Some species in particular can cause havoc for native species – the Asian hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax, eats honey bees and so poses a huge threat.
